Team Work Efforts:
First we make a Slack and WhatsApp group for better with communication between all of team members ,Then we connect a zoom meet discussion about given project.

In zoom meet we divide small parts of project ,to all the team , next all are collecting raw data for project which content is better to merge and easy to complete work.

Daily we connect a meet after scrum then discuss about past days work and that present days work, any one have issue all the team helps to solve the bug.

Finally all push the data to Git hub main branch and do backend of this project, lot more changes will be occur .

Complete given project works after we talk about presentation part of our project ,and we all are efforts goes to final result then we submit Successfully our project with our team efforts.

What We Learn From This?
We all became proficient in reading the code of team members.
How to work and communicate with a team.
How to be more efficient and productive at the same time.
Here I get to know how the team works, how to keep myself and my teammates motivated throughout the ups and downs.
At last, I would like to thank my team members for their support & guidance during the project.
